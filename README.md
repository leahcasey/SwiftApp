# SwiftApp
I developed a multi-screen iPhone app using Swift and CoreData, expanding on a previous project. The app manages a list of items where users can add, delete, update, and mark items as favourites (transferring them to a second table/entity).

I designed the app structure and interface independently, and implemented CoreData integration to generate initial content from an XML file.

The project focused on data persistence, UI/UX design, and personal technical contributions throughout the development process.

Tools: Swift, Xcode, CoreData, XML parsing
